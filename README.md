# Cheatsheet_WritingEnglishDeliciously
Why doesn't someone just say this, the bare minimum cheat sheet for checking your sentences.

## Cheatsheet

This is what a final English writing exam should be in it's entirety, and I mean ONE PAGE ONLY:


Q1) Here is a grammatically bad sentence, fix it by bringing the subject and verb forward as best you can:

... something something ... subject and verb appear late in the sentence.


Q2) A paragraph should have a consistent tense.  Assuming this example is from a past tense paragraph, fix the tense of this sentence to match:

... something something ... mixed tense sentence.


Q3) Commagedon, yes please say that again?  Each phrase of a sentence needs to complete it's own structure -- i.e. don't interrupt what you're trying to say.  Here's a fixer upper, please rewrite with the minimum number of commas where necessary:

The happy and lazy brown fox jumped, over the fence.


Q4) Why is this prose boring me out of my mind?  Remember to write active (not passive) sentences, and in 3rd person if that's your fancy.  Passive sentences can usually be identified as being wordy or verbs having suffixes.  Try rewriting this sentence in the active form:

It seems likely that she'd be the winner.
vs
She is the likely winner.
vs
She is likely to win.
vs
She is winning.

She won.

Good writing will set you free!
